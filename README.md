My Personal MQL4 Backup Folder
This repository serves as a personal backup for my MetaTrader 4 (MQL4) scripts, indicators, experts, and other trading-related files. It's intended to keep all my custom MQL4 development work organized, versioned, and easily accessible across devices.

⚠️ Note: This folder is primarily for personal use and may contain experimental or unfinished code.
